# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Super Suduku 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Our project is going to be a randomized suduku board that can be played repeatedly and possibly even different levels of difficulty for users to interact with.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

  My project be executed through Python and IDLE because it is the programing language I am most comfortable with. My software will include a game board that we have to create and a random number generator that puts them into specific cells. The software will have to understand how the game works and that there can only be one of each number per square, row, and column. The program will have to allow users to select cells and input numbers that are between 1-9 and reject incorrect numbers and invaild inputs. I would like to include an error counter, and some sort of celebration when the user beats the game.
  
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NO

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Name: Dominique Bissey, Email: tuq12944@temple.edu, TA: Rahad Arman Nabid

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my final project would be a board that can continuously randomize and can be used by a user. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for my final project would be allow the user to choose the level of diffficulty and a more customizable, functional game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my final project would be to choose difficulty, make notes on the screen and get hints from the program, almost like an app or website game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

  I will need to learn more about how users can input into a specific self determined location as well as getting the software to determine correct and incorrect inputs. I will need to research more about randomization, user input, and how to connect different parts of my program for example how to get the program to recognize an error then tally it into an error box. This will require understanding many moving parts and I think there will be more challenges and more topics for me to research further. In reference to collaboration I assume we will both being research to both gain the knowledge needed for this project or we may split it up so one of use starts out by developing the board and completing some code we already know and the other will begin reasearch on the less firmilar topic. We can shift back and forth from one working the other researching and visa vera.
